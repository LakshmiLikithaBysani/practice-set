    <p>
        School education provides an excellent opportunity for students to acquire knowledge in
        the field of literature, mathematics, science, politics, history, and numerous other important subjects. 
        Education also plays a major role in shaping the curious minds of young children.It is widely accepted 
        that the learning process is instrumental in shaping oneâ€™s personality and the way he/she deals with
        situations of life. The shift of thoughts from bookish knowledge to knowledge of life, in schools,
         has brought forth a sea of change.
